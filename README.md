# Churn-Prediction

**About**

Customer churn refers to when a customer ends his or her relationship with a company. Online businesses typically treat a customer as churned once a particular amount of time has elapsed since the customerâ€™s last interaction with the site or service. The full cost of churn includes both lost revenue and the marketing costs involved with replacing those customers with new ones. Reducing churn is a key business goal of every online business.
